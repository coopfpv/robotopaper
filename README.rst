===========

A git-friendly, CMake-powered LaTeX-article template for those who prefer DIY to cloud solutions [*]. 

This sort of thing will be overkill for some (most?). 
However, the use of a fully-featured build system (CMake_) allows for a powerful
combination of offline-usability and reproducible publications - with the right
configuration of data, analysis scripts, and build scripts you could run your data-analysis, produce your plots, and compile the PDF with a single command.

(Note that there's nothing quite so complex in this basic template - you'll need some CMake skills if you want to start getting clever).

The original template was put together by `John Swinbank`_ for the `TraP paper`_. 
Filleted back to a bare-bones example by Tim Staley. 
BSD licensed, go forth and fork.
